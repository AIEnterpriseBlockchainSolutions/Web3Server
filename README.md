# Web3Server 🚀🚀🚀

This is the **blazingly fast ⚡️, bleeding-edge 🪄** webserver used in all AIEBS projects that is using the **Web 3.0 enterprise WebPageFlexibleFastEasyImageConverter 💫** - which uses a **mobile-first, seo-friendly** and certainly **revolutionary approach to server-side-rendering**.

It serves content by heavily integrating the Web 3.0 functionality that the WebPageFlexibleFastEasyImageConverter is bringing to the table and using other **enterprise-grade technologies** such as Redis for content caching.

The AIEBS Web3Server provides an **AI-powered caching system** that stores the with the WebPageFlexibleFastEasyImageConverter generated results of a given page to a **smart cache** that automagically removes cache objects that are no longer used.
